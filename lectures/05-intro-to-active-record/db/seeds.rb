# Activity #2 => Using Seed Data

# Create two Clinics and five Patients, making sure to associate
# each Patient with one Clinic via the "clinic_id" foreign key.

# Run 'rake db:seed' to add this information to your DB, making sure
# to verify that the DB has been populated with the appropriate resources.

# BONUS => What Rake command would we run to ensure that our DB doesn't
# contain duplicate data? Add another Clinic and re-seed your DB before confirming 
# that there are no duplicates (i.e., 3 Clinics instead of 5).

# Confirmation Message
